  <h1>The Battle Ship Metaphor</h1>
  <p>I am henry. I write this shitpost to explain how blink's core mechanic works (the battleship game).</p>

  <h2>Wtf is that?</h2>
  <p>If you are a newborn or a 10 yo with autism, battle ship is simply a game where you have to shoot down enemy's battleship without knowing where their battleship is.</p>
  <p>So that "where" for blink is basically a process to locate the path to skip walls or any obstruction during the path finding process to the final destination.</p>
  <p>Imagine the server and your game as enemy and the player respectively. Like irl battleship game, there's a wall that distants the 2 sides out. On Hypixel, </p>
  <p>that wall is the server preventing the client from knowing how to go to the destination without getting obstructed. However, what if you add</p>
  <p>a spectator to the irl battleship game? Well, you now have a middleman to help you know where the enemy's ships are. Likewise, NOCOM helps blink know where</p>
  <p>to go without bonking your head into the wall or getting lagged back. So yeah, that's it, you can dm @zzzdeefer for more details or go on x perm's github for the nitty gritty nerdy shit i won't be bother.</p>
